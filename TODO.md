Short Term Proposals
====================
* Write tests for archive_plaintext and core.py.
* Better abstract the check to see if main_loop is done.
* Improve core.clean_up, so that it outputs less about cancelled tasks.
* Implement post field shorthands in get_filters.
* Clean up tests and ensure that they properly cover code.
* Distinguish standard library packages from third party packages in the compilation script. 


Long Term Proposals
===================
* A GUI? There are mentions of a GUI in the you-get source code, why not have one for this?
